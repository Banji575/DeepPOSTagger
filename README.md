# DeepPOSTagger
DeepPOSTagger is a sophisticated natural language processing tool designed for Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging using deep learning techniques. This repository contains the complete codebase for training and evaluating a neural network model that effectively tags words in a sentence with their corresponding parts of speech.
## Features

- Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for building and training a bidirectional GRU-based model.
- Employs NLTK for initial text processing and data preparation.
- Includes detailed preprocessing steps, including tokenization and padding.
- Implements custom accuracy metrics for evaluating model performance.
- Provides a robust training pipeline with model checkpoints and TensorBoard integration for monitoring.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Banji575/DeepPOSTagger.git
```

Navigate to the cloned directory:
``` bash
cd DeepPOSTagger
```


Install the required dependencies:
``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


You can modify the training parameters in the script according to your dataset and requirements.

## Dataset

The model is designed to work with the Penn Treebank dataset, but it can be adapted for other POS tagging datasets.
